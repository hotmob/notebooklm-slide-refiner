Reconstruct this image to publishing-quality high definition. Strictly maintain the original 16:9 aspect ratio, layout logic, and color scheme. Eliminate all noise and blur.
Primary Goal: Readability. Re-render all text to be vector-sharp and extremely crisp. Replace any illegible text with the exact original content using a modern, clean sans-serif font.
Specific Edit: Remove the text 'NotebookLM' and corner marks.
Constraint: Do not change the background color. Ensure uniform background color is preserved. Use anti-aliasing for all edges. No artifacts.
